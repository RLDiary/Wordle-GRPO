Given the feedback \"YYYBB\", we know:\n- The first three letters are \"cor\".\n- The last two letters are \"ny\".\n\nI will generate a new guess that fits these criteria and is a common word. \"corny\" was close, but let's try \"crane\" again, as it has a good mix of letters and positions.\n\nanswer: crane<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\ncrane -> YGBBB<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nthink: The feedback \"YGBBB\" indicates that:\n- \"c\" is in the word and in position 1.\n- \"r\" is in the word and in position 2.\n- \"a\" is in the word but not in position 3.\n- \"n\" is not in the word (position 3).\n- \"e\" is not in the word (position 4).\n- \"b\" is not in the word (position 5).\n\nGiven this new information, I can further refine my list of possible words.

Your goal is to correctly guess the hidden 5-letter word within six attempts. The game provides feedback after each guess, which you must use to refine your subsequent guesses. Follow these rules and strategies carefully:\n\n== Wordle Rules ==\n1. The target word is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word.\n2. After each guess, you will receive feedback consisting of a string of 5 characters using the letters:\n   - G (Green): Correct letter in the correct position.\n   - Y (Yellow): Correct letter in the wrong position.\n   - B (Black): Letter is not in the target word at all.\n3. Use the feedback to eliminate invalid words and improve future guesses.\n\n== Feedback Interpretation Examples ==\n- Target word: \"hello\"\n- Guess: \"world\"\n- Feedback: \"BYBGB\"\n  Explanation:\n    - \"w\" \u2192 B: not in the target word\n    - \"o\" \u2192 Y: in the word, but not in position 2\n    - \"r\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n    - \"l\" \u2192 G: correct letter and position (index 3)\n    - \"d\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n\n== Your Responsibilities ==\n- Generate a single valid 5-letter English word for each turn.\n- Use previous guesses and their feedback to eliminate impossible candidates.\n- Prioritize guesses that test multiple hypotheses (e.g., new letters or positions) when unsure.\n- Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning before producing each guess.\n\n== Output Format ==\nYour response must follow this structure:\n<think>Explain your reasoning and deduction based on prior guesses and feedback.</think><answer>guess</answer>\n\n- The text inside <think> and </think> should include your full reasoning step by step. Do not ignore this step.\n- The word inside <answer> and </answer> must be your final guess.\n- The guess must be a single valid 5-letter English word in lowercase only.\n- Do not include any other text outside of the <think> and <answer> tags.\n\n== Goal ==\nCorrectly identify the hidden word using logical deduction and strategic guessing, with clear and structured reasoning output.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your first guess?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "think: For the first guess, I will go with a common 5-letter word that has a good mix of letters and positions. \"crane\" seems like a good starting point as it has a mix of vowels and consonants, and it doesn't have any repeated letters that might give away too much information.

Your goal is to correctly guess the hidden 5-letter word within six attempts. The game provides feedback after each guess, which you must use to refine your subsequent guesses. Follow these rules and strategies carefully:\n\n== Wordle Rules ==\n1. The target word is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word.\n2. After each guess, you will receive feedback consisting of a string of 5 characters using the letters:\n   - G (Green): Correct letter in the correct position.\n   - Y (Yellow): Correct letter in the wrong position.\n   - B (Black): Letter is not in the target word at all.\n3. Use the feedback to eliminate invalid words and improve future guesses.\n\n== Feedback Interpretation Examples ==\n- Target word: \"hello\"\n- Guess: \"world\"\n- Feedback: \"BYBGB\"\n  Explanation:\n    - \"w\" \u2192 B: not in the target word\n    - \"o\" \u2192 Y: in the word, but not in position 2\n    - \"r\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n    - \"l\" \u2192 G: correct letter and position (index 3)\n    - \"d\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n\n== Your Responsibilities ==\n- Generate a single valid 5-letter English word for each turn.\n- Use previous guesses and their feedback to eliminate impossible candidates.\n- Prioritize guesses that test multiple hypotheses (e.g., new letters or positions) when unsure.\n- Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning before producing each guess.\n\n== Output Format ==\nYour response must follow this structure:\n<think>Explain your reasoning and deduction based on prior guesses and feedback.</think><answer>guess</answer>\n\n- The text inside <think> and </think> should include your full reasoning step by step. Do not ignore this step.\n- The word inside <answer> and </answer> must be your final guess.\n- The guess must be a single valid 5-letter English word in lowercase only.\n- Do not include any other text outside of the <think> and <answer> tags.\n\n== Goal ==\nCorrectly identify the hidden word using logical deduction and strategic guessing, with clear and structured reasoning output.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your first guess?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "think: For my first guess, I will start with a common 5-letter word that has a mix of letters and positions. \"crane\" seems like a good starting point as it has a mix of vowels and consonants, and it doesn't have any repeated letters.

0.0, -1.0, 0.0], ["4", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a Wordle solver. Your goal is to correctly guess the hidden 5-letter word within six attempts. The game provides feedback after each guess, which you must use to refine your subsequent guesses. Follow these rules and strategies carefully:\n\n== Wordle Rules ==\n1. The target word is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word.\n2. After each guess, you will receive feedback consisting of a string of 5 characters using the letters:\n   - G (Green): Correct letter in the correct position.\n   - Y (Yellow): Correct letter in the wrong position.\n   - B (Black): Letter is not in the target word at all.\n3. Use the feedback to eliminate invalid words and improve future guesses.\n\n== Feedback Interpretation Examples ==\n- Target word: \"hello\"\n- Guess: \"world\"\n- Feedback: \"BYBGB\"\n  Explanation:\n    - \"w\" \u2192 B: not in the target word\n    - \"o\" \u2192 Y: in the word, but not in position 2\n    - \"r\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n    - \"l\" \u2192 G: correct letter and position (index 3)\n    - \"d\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n\n== Your Responsibilities ==\n- Generate a single valid 5-letter English word for each turn.\n- Use previous guesses and their feedback to eliminate impossible candidates.\n- Prioritize guesses that test multiple hypotheses (e.g., new letters or positions) when unsure.\n- Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning before producing each guess.\n\n== Output Format ==\nYour response must follow this structure:\n<think>Explain your reasoning and deduction based on prior guesses and feedback.</think><answer>guess</answer>\n\n- The text inside <think> and </think> should include your full reasoning step by step. Do not ignore this step.\n- The word inside <answer> and </answer> must be your final guess.\n- The guess must be a single valid 5-letter English word in lowercase only.\n- Do not include any other text outside of the <think> and <answer> tags.\n\n== Goal ==\nCorrectly identify the hidden word using logical deduction and strategic guessing, with clear and structured reasoning output.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your first guess?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "think: For the first guess, we should aim to gather as much information as possible about the hidden word. A good starting point is to include a mix of letters that are likely to appear in the word. Let's choose \"crane\" as our first guess. This word has a mix of vowels and consonants and is a valid English word.\n\nanswer: crane<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\ncrane -> YGBBB<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nthink: The feedback \"YGBBB\" indicates that 'c' is in the word but not in the first position, 'r' is in the word but not in the second position, and 'e' is not in the word at all. This leaves us with the following information:\n- The first position is not 'c' or 'r'.\n- The second position is not 'r'.\n- The third, fourth, and fifth positions do not contain 'e'.\n\nGiven this information, we can eliminate words that do not fit these criteria. For example, words that start with 'c' or 'r', or end with 'e' are no longer possible. Let's generate a new guess based on this.\n\nanswer: crony<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\ncrony -> YGGBB<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nthink: The feedback \"YGGBB\" provides us with more specific information:\n- 'c' is in the word and in the first position.\n- 'r' is in the word and in the third position.\n- 'n' is in the word but not in the second or fourth position.\n- 'o' is not in the word at all.\n- 'y' is not in the word at all.\n\nWith this information, we can further narrow down the possibilities:\n- The first position is 'c'.\n- The third position is 'r'.\n- The second and fourth positions are not 'n', 'o', or 'y'.\n- The fifth position is not 'e'.\n\nLet's generate a new guess that tests these hypotheses while also introducing new possibilities.

0.0, -1.0, 0.0], ["4", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a Wordle solver. Your goal is to correctly guess the hidden 5-letter word within six attempts. The game provides feedback after each guess, which you must use to refine your subsequent guesses. Follow these rules and strategies carefully:\n\n== Wordle Rules ==\n1. The target word is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word.\n2. After each guess, you will receive feedback consisting of a string of 5 characters using the letters:\n   - G (Green): Correct letter in the correct position.\n   - Y (Yellow): Correct letter in the wrong position.\n   - B (Black): Letter is not in the target word at all.\n3. Use the feedback to eliminate invalid words and improve future guesses.\n\n== Feedback Interpretation Examples ==\n- Target word: \"hello\"\n- Guess: \"world\"\n- Feedback: \"BYBGB\"\n  Explanation:\n    - \"w\" \u2192 B: not in the target word\n    - \"o\" \u2192 Y: in the word, but not in position 2\n    - \"r\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n    - \"l\" \u2192 G: correct letter and position (index 3)\n    - \"d\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n\n== Your Responsibilities ==\n- Generate a single valid 5-letter English word for each turn.\n- Use previous guesses and their feedback to eliminate impossible candidates.\n- Prioritize guesses that test multiple hypotheses (e.g., new letters or positions) when unsure.\n- Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning before producing each guess.\n\n== Output Format ==\nYour response must follow this structure:\n<think>Explain your reasoning and deduction based on prior guesses and feedback.</think><answer>guess</answer>\n\n- The text inside <think> and </think> should include your full reasoning step by step. Do not ignore this step.\n- The word inside <answer> and </answer> must be your final guess.\n- The guess must be a single valid 5-letter English word in lowercase only.\n- Do not include any other text outside of the <think> and <answer> tags.\n\n== Goal ==\nCorrectly identify the hidden word using logical deduction and strategic guessing, with clear and structured reasoning output.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your first guess?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "think: For the first guess, we should aim to gather as much information as possible. A good starting point is a word that contains a variety of letters and positions. \"crane\" seems like a good candidate because it has a mix of vowels and consonants, and it can potentially give us information about different parts of the word.\n\nanswer: crane<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\ncrane -> YGBBB<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nthink: The feedback \"YGBBB\" indicates that \"c\" is in the word but not in the first position, \"r\" is in the word but not in the second position, and \"a\" is not in the word at all. This leaves us with the positions for \"e\" and \"n\" to determine.\n\nGiven the feedback, we can eliminate words that contain \"c\" in the first position, \"r\" in the second position, and any word that does not contain \"a\".

Let's consider a word that might fit the feedback better and still provide useful information. \"crane\" did not work, so let's try another common word that has a mix of vowels and consonants.\n\nA good candidate could be \"crane\" but with a different word that fits the feedback.

Your goal is to correctly guess the hidden 5-letter word within six attempts. The game provides feedback after each guess, which you must use to refine your subsequent guesses. Follow these rules and strategies carefully:\n\n== Wordle Rules ==\n1. The target word is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word.\n2. After each guess, you will receive feedback consisting of a string of 5 characters using the letters:\n   - G (Green): Correct letter in the correct position.\n   - Y (Yellow): Correct letter in the wrong position.\n   - B (Black): Letter is not in the target word at all.\n3.
