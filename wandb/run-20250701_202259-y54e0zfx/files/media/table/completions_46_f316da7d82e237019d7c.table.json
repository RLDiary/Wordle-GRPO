0.0, -1.0, 0.0], ["7", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a Wordle solver. Your goal is to correctly guess the hidden 5-letter word within six attempts. The game provides feedback after each guess, which you must use to refine your subsequent guesses. Follow these rules and strategies carefully:\n\n== Wordle Rules ==\n1. The target word is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word.\n2. After each guess, you will receive feedback consisting of a string of 5 characters using the letters:\n   - G (Green): Correct letter in the correct position.\n   - Y (Yellow): Correct letter in the wrong position.\n   - B (Black): Letter is not in the target word at all.\n3. Use the feedback to eliminate invalid words and improve future guesses.\n\n== Feedback Interpretation Examples ==\n- Target word: \"hello\"\n- Guess: \"world\"\n- Feedback: \"BYBGB\"\n  Explanation:\n    - \"w\" \u2192 B: not in the target word\n    - \"o\" \u2192 Y: in the word, but not in position 2\n    - \"r\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n    - \"l\" \u2192 G: correct letter and position (index 3)\n    - \"d\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n\n== Your Responsibilities ==\n- Generate a single valid 5-letter English word for each turn.\n- Use previous guesses and their feedback to eliminate impossible candidates.\n- Prioritize guesses that test multiple hypotheses (e.g., new letters or positions) when unsure.\n- Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning before producing each guess.\n\n== Output Format ==\nYour response must follow this structure:\n<think>Explain your reasoning and deduction based on prior guesses and feedback.</think><answer>guess</answer>\n\n- The text inside <think> and </think> should include your full reasoning step by step. Do not ignore this step.\n- The word inside <answer> and </answer> must be your final guess.\n- The guess must be a single valid 5-letter English word in lowercase only.\n- Do not include any other text outside of the <think> and <answer> tags.\n\n== Goal ==\nCorrectly identify the hidden word using logical deduction and strategic guessing, with clear and structured reasoning output.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your first guess?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "think: For the first guess, we want to gather as much information as possible about the hidden word. A good strategy is to use a word that has a mix of letters and positions that can help us deduce the hidden word. Let's try \"crane\".\n\nanswer: crane<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\ncrane -> BBGBG<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nthink: The feedback \"BBGBG\" indicates that:\n- The letter 'c' is not in the word (B).\n- The letter 'r' is not in the word (B).\n- The letter 'a' is in the word but not in the position (G).\n- The letter 'n' is in the word and in the position (G).\n\nThis means that the hidden word contains the letters 'a' and 'n' but not 'c' or 'r'. It also tells us that the letter 'a' is in the 2nd position and the letter 'n' is in the 4th position.\n\nGiven this information, we can eliminate words that do not contain 'a' in the 2nd position or 'n' in the 4th position. We can also eliminate words that contain 'c' or 'r'.\n\nanswer: crane<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\ncrane -> BBGBG<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nthink: The feedback \"BBGBG\" confirms that the hidden word contains the letters 'a' and 'n' in the 2nd and 4th positions, respectively, and does not contain the letters 'c' or 'r'. Let's list the possible positions for the remaining letters 'b', 'e', and 'l' based on the feedback.\n\n- The letter 'a' is in the 2nd position.\n- The letter 'n' is in the 4th position.\n- The letter 'b' is not in the word (B).\n- The letter 'g' is not in the word (B).\n- The letter 'e' is not in the word (B).\n- The letter 'l' is not in the word (B).\n\nThis means that the hidden word must be a combination of 'a' in the 2nd position, 'n' in the 4th position, and the letters 'b', 'e', and 'l' in the remaining positions (1st, 3rd, and 5th).\n\nGiven this, we can eliminate words that do not fit this pattern. We can also prioritize words that include the letters 'b', 'e', and 'l' in the remaining positions.\n\nLet's try a word that fits these criteria, such as \"banel\".\n\nanswer: banel<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nInvalid word, not a valid English word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nthink: Since \"banel\" is not a valid English word, we need to find another word that fits the criteria.

Therefore, the 5th position can be 'b', 'a', 'k', or 'e'.\n\nTo narrow down the possibilities, let's consider the most common letters and their positions:\n- 'a' is not in the 2nd position (B), so it could be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th.\n- 'b' is not in the 1st position (B), so it could be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.\n- 'k' is not in the 3rd position (B), so it could be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th.\n- 'e' is not in the 4th position (B), so it could be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.\n- 'r' is not in the 5th position (B), so it could be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.\n\nLet's try a word that fits these criteria, such as \"baker\".\n\nanswer: barker<|im_end|><|im_start|>user\nInvalid word, not a 5 letter word<|im_end|>\n", 0.0, -1.0, 0.0], ["7", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a Wordle solver. Your goal is to correctly guess the hidden 5-letter word within six attempts. The game provides feedback after each guess, which you must use to refine your subsequent guesses. Follow these rules and strategies carefully:\n\n== Wordle Rules ==\n1. The target word is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word.\n2. After each guess, you will receive feedback consisting of a string of 5 characters using the letters:\n   - G (Green): Correct letter in the correct position.\n   - Y (Yellow): Correct letter in the wrong position.\n   - B (Black): Letter is not in the target word at all.\n3. Use the feedback to eliminate invalid words and improve future guesses.\n\n== Feedback Interpretation Examples ==\n- Target word: \"hello\"\n- Guess: \"world\"\n- Feedback: \"BYBGB\"\n  Explanation:\n    - \"w\" \u2192 B: not in the target word\n    - \"o\" \u2192 Y: in the word, but not in position 2\n    - \"r\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n    - \"l\" \u2192 G: correct letter and position (index 3)\n    - \"d\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n\n== Your Responsibilities ==\n- Generate a single valid 5-letter English word for each turn.\n- Use previous guesses and their feedback to eliminate impossible candidates.\n- Prioritize guesses that test multiple hypotheses (e.g., new letters or positions) when unsure.\n- Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning before producing each guess.\n\n== Output Format ==\nYour response must follow this structure:\n<think>Explain your reasoning and deduction based on prior guesses and feedback.</think><answer>guess</answer>\n\n- The text inside <think> and </think> should include your full reasoning step by step. Do not ignore this step.\n- The word inside <answer> and </answer> must be your final guess.\n- The guess must be a single valid 5-letter English word in lowercase only.\n- Do not include any other text outside of the <think> and <answer> tags.\n\n== Goal ==\nCorrectly identify the hidden word using logical deduction and strategic guessing, with clear and structured reasoning output.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your first guess?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "think: For the first guess, I will go with a common 5-letter word that has a mix of letters and positions that can help narrow down possibilities.
