The game provides feedback after each guess, which you must use to refine your subsequent guesses. Follow these rules and strategies carefully:\n\n== Wordle Rules ==\n1. The target word is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word.\n2. After each guess, you will receive feedback consisting of a string of 5 characters using the letters:\n   - G (Green): Correct letter in the correct position.\n   - Y (Yellow): Correct letter in the wrong position.\n   - B (Black): Letter is not in the target word at all.\n3. Use the feedback to eliminate invalid words and improve future guesses.\n\n== Feedback Interpretation Examples ==\n- Target word: \"hello\"\n- Guess: \"world\"\n- Feedback: \"BYBGB\"\n  Explanation:\n    - \"w\" \u2192 B: not in the target word\n    - \"o\" \u2192 Y: in the word, but not in position 2\n    - \"r\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n    - \"l\" \u2192 G: correct letter and position (index 3)\n    - \"d\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n\n== Your Responsibilities ==\n- Generate a single valid 5-letter English word for each turn.\n- Use previous guesses and their feedback to eliminate impossible candidates.\n- Prioritize guesses that test multiple hypotheses (e.g., new letters or positions) when unsure.\n- Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning before producing each guess.\n\n== Output Format ==\nYour response must follow this structure:\n<think>Explain your reasoning and deduction based on prior guesses and feedback.</think><answer>guess</answer>\n\n- The text inside <think> and </think> should include your full reasoning step by step. Do not ignore this step.\n- The word inside <answer> and </answer> must be your final guess.\n- The guess must be a single valid 5-letter English word in lowercase only.\n- Do not include any other text outside of the <think> and <answer> tags.\n\n== Goal ==\nCorrectly identify the hidden word using logical deduction and strategic guessing, with clear and structured reasoning output."

Viable English words there are rare; most end with \u201cst\u201d or have other banned letters (\u201csat\u2026\u201d variants contain a, e, or l). The cleanest option I find is \u201cshats\u201d (adds h, h, s).\n\n\u2022 If s were at position 4 we\u2019d get ? a ? t s. Scanning for real words, \u201cgiant\u201d fits perfectly: g i a n t (puts s at index 4, keeps a at index 1, t at index 3; introduces g, i, n as new letters).\n\nBetween \u201cshats\u201d and \u201cgiant\u201d, \u201cgiant\u201d uses three totally new consonants (g, n) plus the vowel i, giving richer information than \u201cshats\u201d, which repeats s and only adds two new letters (h, h). Therefore \u201cgiant\u201d is the more informative next guess.</think><answer>giant</answer>"
