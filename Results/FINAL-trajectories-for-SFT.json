The two common candidates are:\n\n\u2022 baron  \n\u2022 caron  (an accent mark; rarer vocabulary)\n\n\u201cBaron\u201d is the far more familiar everyday English word and is present in the official Wordle answer list, whereas \u201ccaron\u201d is only in the wider guess list. Hence \u201cbaron\u201d is overwhelmingly more likely to be the target.\n\nWe guess \u201cbaron\u201d, which either solves the puzzle or tells us that the initial consonant is not B, in which case \u201ccaron\u201d will be the only remaining solution.</think><answer>baron</answer>"

The target word is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word.\n2. After each guess, you will receive feedback consisting of a string of 5 characters using the letters:\n   - G (Green): Correct letter in the correct position.\n   - Y (Yellow): Correct letter in the wrong position.\n   - B (Black): Letter is not in the target word at all.\n3. Use the feedback to eliminate invalid words and improve future guesses.\n\n== Feedback Interpretation Examples ==\n- Target word: \"hello\"\n- Guess: \"world\"\n- Feedback: \"BYBGB\"\n  Explanation:\n    - \"w\" \u2192 B: not in the target word\n    - \"o\" \u2192 Y: in the word, but not in position 2\n    - \"r\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n    - \"l\" \u2192 G: correct letter and position (index 3)\n    - \"d\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n\n== Your Responsibilities ==\n- Generate a single valid 5-letter English word for each turn.\n- Use previous guesses and their feedback to eliminate impossible candidates.\n- Prioritize guesses that test multiple hypotheses (e.g., new letters or positions) when unsure.\n- Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning before producing each guess.\n\n== Output Format ==\nYour response must follow this structure:\n<think>Explain your reasoning and deduction based on prior guesses and feedback.</think><answer>guess</answer>\n\n- The text inside <think> and </think> should include your full reasoning step by step.

The game provides feedback after each guess, which you must use to refine your subsequent guesses. Follow these rules and strategies carefully:\n\n== Wordle Rules ==\n1. The target word is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word.\n2. After each guess, you will receive feedback consisting of a string of 5 characters using the letters:\n   - G (Green): Correct letter in the correct position.\n   - Y (Yellow): Correct letter in the wrong position.\n   - B (Black): Letter is not in the target word at all.\n3. Use the feedback to eliminate invalid words and improve future guesses.\n\n== Feedback Interpretation Examples ==\n- Target word: \"hello\"\n- Guess: \"world\"\n- Feedback: \"BYBGB\"\n  Explanation:\n    - \"w\" \u2192 B: not in the target word\n    - \"o\" \u2192 Y: in the word, but not in position 2\n    - \"r\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n    - \"l\" \u2192 G: correct letter and position (index 3)\n    - \"d\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n\n== Your Responsibilities ==\n- Generate a single valid 5-letter English word for each turn.\n- Use previous guesses and their feedback to eliminate impossible candidates.\n- Prioritize guesses that test multiple hypotheses (e.g., new letters or positions) when unsure.\n- Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning before producing each guess.\n\n== Output Format ==\nYour response must follow this structure:\n<think>Explain your reasoning and deduction based on prior guesses and feedback.</think><answer>guess</answer>\n\n- The text inside <think> and </think> should include your full reasoning step by step. Do not ignore this step.\n- The word inside <answer> and </answer> must be your final guess.\n- The guess must be a single valid 5-letter English word in lowercase only.\n- Do not include any other text outside of the <think> and <answer> tags.\n\n== Goal ==\nCorrectly identify the hidden word using logical deduction and strategic guessing, with clear and structured reasoning output."

The game provides feedback after each guess, which you must use to refine your subsequent guesses. Follow these rules and strategies carefully:\n\n== Wordle Rules ==\n1. The target word is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word.\n2. After each guess, you will receive feedback consisting of a string of 5 characters using the letters:\n   - G (Green): Correct letter in the correct position.\n   - Y (Yellow): Correct letter in the wrong position.\n   - B (Black): Letter is not in the target word at all.\n3. Use the feedback to eliminate invalid words and improve future guesses.\n\n== Feedback Interpretation Examples ==\n- Target word: \"hello\"\n- Guess: \"world\"\n- Feedback: \"BYBGB\"\n  Explanation:\n    - \"w\" \u2192 B: not in the target word\n    - \"o\" \u2192 Y: in the word, but not in position 2\n    - \"r\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n    - \"l\" \u2192 G: correct letter and position (index 3)\n    - \"d\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n\n== Your Responsibilities ==\n- Generate a single valid 5-letter English word for each turn.\n- Use previous guesses and their feedback to eliminate impossible candidates.\n- Prioritize guesses that test multiple hypotheses (e.g., new letters or positions) when unsure.\n- Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning before producing each guess.\n\n== Output Format ==\nYour response must follow this structure:\n<think>Explain your reasoning and deduction based on prior guesses and feedback.</think><answer>guess</answer>\n\n- The text inside <think> and </think> should include your full reasoning step by step. Do not ignore this step.\n- The word inside <answer> and </answer> must be your final guess.\n- The guess must be a single valid 5-letter English word in lowercase only.\n- Do not include any other text outside of the <think> and <answer> tags.\n\n== Goal ==\nCorrectly identify the hidden word using logical deduction and strategic guessing, with clear and structured reasoning output."

The game provides feedback after each guess, which you must use to refine your subsequent guesses. Follow these rules and strategies carefully:\n\n== Wordle Rules ==\n1. The target word is exactly 5 letters long and is a valid English word.\n2. After each guess, you will receive feedback consisting of a string of 5 characters using the letters:\n   - G (Green): Correct letter in the correct position.\n   - Y (Yellow): Correct letter in the wrong position.\n   - B (Black): Letter is not in the target word at all.\n3. Use the feedback to eliminate invalid words and improve future guesses.\n\n== Feedback Interpretation Examples ==\n- Target word: \"hello\"\n- Guess: \"world\"\n- Feedback: \"BYBGB\"\n  Explanation:\n    - \"w\" \u2192 B: not in the target word\n    - \"o\" \u2192 Y: in the word, but not in position 2\n    - \"r\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n    - \"l\" \u2192 G: correct letter and position (index 3)\n    - \"d\" \u2192 B: not in the word\n\n== Your Responsibilities ==\n- Generate a single valid 5-letter English word for each turn.\n- Use previous guesses and their feedback to eliminate impossible candidates.\n- Prioritize guesses that test multiple hypotheses (e.g., new letters or positions) when unsure.\n- Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning before producing each guess.\n\n== Output Format ==\nYour response must follow this structure:\n<think>Explain your reasoning and deduction based on prior guesses and feedback.</think><answer>guess</answer>\n\n- The text inside <think> and </think> should include your full reasoning step by step.
